# dpi
Distance Power Index (DPI): A Shiny application that produces NCAA track power rankings &amp; race simulations. 

## Why DPI?
The work here was done to create an automated system of NCAA distance running power rankings, similar to the coverage sports like the NBA, NFL, and WNBA get from larger media companies. Since no system existed before, this was an opportunity to create something new for the distane running community.

## How Does It Work?
Runners get scores based on their performances, and scores are relative to how they perform compared to others. Based on scores, athletes then earn an overall rank metric which determines where they land in the power rankings.

## What Divisions Does It Cover?
Right now, we cover D1, D2 and D3. There is potential to add NAIA and JuCo as well.

## What "tech-stack" Do You Use?
R, Shiny, AWS - mainly. Not all of the backend code for scoring is shown here. Some is kept private as to not give away too much on how we decide to award an athlete points. 

## What's Next?
Hopefully, a lot. You can read more in the "About" section on the actual Shiny application.
